# java-gamejolt-archiver
archives .jar games from gamejolt


I made this because i wanted to play notch's older games without enabling applets on my browser which can be really insecure.


Example Usage:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python3 java-archiver.py -u https://gamejolt.com/games/left-4k-dead/215 -c`

The following will scrape the .jar, and create a cheerpj HTML file intended for serving on a web server
